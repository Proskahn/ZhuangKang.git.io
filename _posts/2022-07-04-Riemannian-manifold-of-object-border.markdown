In the blog "image segmentation via manifold optimization" we consider the space of all closed curves to be a Riemannian
 manifold. To minimize function on manifold via optimization mehtod, the geodescic completeness of manifold is the primary
  requirement. In this report we discuss the completeness properties of this Riemannian manifold.
